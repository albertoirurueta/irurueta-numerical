/**
 * Estimates coefficients of a polynomial passing through provided set of x and y points.
 * This implementation is more accurate than other implementations such as implementations of
 * {@link com.irurueta.numerical.polynomials.estimators.PolynomialEstimator}.
 * Those implementations are based on curve fitting a polynomial of a given degree based on a number
 * of points that can be much larger than the number of points, which results in a polynomial that
 * does not exactly pass through provided points, but provides a minimum square error result.
 * On the other hand, this implementation builds a polynomial of order equal to the length of
 * provided x and y points.
 * Ths implementation is more accurate than {@link SimpleInterpolatingPolynomialEstimator}, at the
 * expense of greater computational cost (N^3 of this method vs N^2 of the simple one).
