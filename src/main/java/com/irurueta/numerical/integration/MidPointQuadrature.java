/**
 * Implementation of quadrature using mid-point algorithm.
 * Mid-point algorithm is suitable for improper integrations, which consists of the following
 * situations:
 * - integrand goes to a finite limiting value at finite upper and lower limits, but cannot be
 * evaluated right on one of those limits (e.g. sin(x)/x at x = 0)
 * - the upper limit is positive infinity, or the lower limit is negative infinity.
 * - integrand has an integrable singularity at either limit (e.g. x^-0.5 at x = 0)
 * - integrand has an integrable singularity at a known place between its upper and lower limits.
 * - integrand has an integrable singularity at an unknown place between its upper and lower limits.
 * <p>
 * Impossible integrals, such as those being infinite (e.g. integral from 1 to infinity of x^-1) or
 * those that have no limiting sense (e.g. integral from -infinity to infinity of cos(x)) cannot
 * be handled by this implementation.
